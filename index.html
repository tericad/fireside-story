      <p>It was a <em>dark and stormy</em> night...</p>
      <p>
        The rain was drowned out by the roaring waves against the seashore
      </p>
      <p>The thunder and lightening were very, very frightening.</p>
      <p>
        A dark figure stood on the balcony of the lighthouse
      </p>
      <p>The lightening illuminated a knife in one hand.</p>
